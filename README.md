# Vishap Oberon Project Website

This is a very basic built using vi and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org). Tested on Nokia N900 running Maemo-leste using NetSurf Web Browser.

## Roadmap

Ideally, we should do the following

- [ ] Move the website to Hugo
- [ ] Import content from the old blog and Wiki
- [ ] Import Oberon By Examples
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add links to existing cool projects
